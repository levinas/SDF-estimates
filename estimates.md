## Explanations for Estimates

##### 1.1 Revised size estimate for the N x N matrix and output size

DB36: 

Notes from the [FastBLAST paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003589):

> Our limit of 1/2,000 may not seem stringent, but some proteins are
> homologous to over 1/100 of all proteins (e.g., gi 16121781 has
> 107,873 homologs at 45 bits or above, which represents about 2% of
> Genbank NR).
