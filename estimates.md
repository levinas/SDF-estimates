## Summary

1. List of which similarity blocks have been computed and an estimate for when the entire set might be completed
   - [ ] Revised size estimate for the N x N matrix and output size
   - [ ] Revised computational effort (cup hours) estimate for N x N matrix

2. Summary statistics on the metagenome assemblies for each block
   - [ ] Number of reads input
   - [ ] Number of contigs output and N50
   - [ ] Number of proteins called from each caller
   - [ ] Number of unique proteins in the block
   - [ ] Mean number of internally similar proteins at X cutoff (distribution)
   - [ ] Size distribution and GC ratios
   - [ ] Fraction with confident function assignments
   - [ ] Fraction with no similar hits in sample and DB36
   - [ ] Estimate of number of novel proteins

3. Contiguity and pathway related estimates
